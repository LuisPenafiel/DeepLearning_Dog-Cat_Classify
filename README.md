# Image Classifier Project

## Overview

This project is focused on building an image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to classify images into different categories, such as distinguishing between cats and dogs. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. The code is written in Python and utilizes popular libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and Pandas.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several sections, each corresponding to a specific step in the image classification pipeline:

1. **Installation of Required Libraries**: The project requires TensorFlow, Keras, and Pandas. The necessary installations are included in the notebook.

2. **Data Import and Preprocessing**: The dataset is imported from a specified directory. The data is then preprocessed using TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator` to handle image augmentation and normalization.

3. **Model Building**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is built using Keras. The model includes layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, and Dense layers. Data augmentation techniques like random flips, rotations, and zooms are also applied.

4. **Model Training**: The model is trained using the preprocessed data. Callbacks such as `ModelCheckpoint`, `EarlyStopping`, and `CSVLogger` are used to monitor the training process and save the best model.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on a test dataset to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy and loss are used to evaluate the model.

6. **Data Visualization**: The project includes code for visualizing the training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs using Matplotlib.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image processing)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy matplotlib opencv-python
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required libraries using the command above.

3. **Run the Notebook**: Open the Jupyter notebook (`Image_classifier-project (1).ipynb`) and run each cell sequentially to execute the project.

4. **Dataset**: Ensure that your dataset is organized in the specified directory structure. The dataset should be split into training and validation sets, with each class (e.g., cats and dogs) in separate folders.

5. **Training**: Modify the model architecture or training parameters as needed and train the model.

6. **Evaluation**: After training, evaluate the model on the test dataset and visualize the results.

## Key Features

- **Data Augmentation**: The project uses TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator` to apply various data augmentation techniques, which helps in improving the model's generalization.

- **Model Checkpointing**: The best model is saved during training using `ModelCheckpoint`, ensuring that you can reload the best-performing model later.

- **Early Stopping**: Training stops early if the validation loss does not improve, preventing overfitting.

- **Visualization**: Training and validation metrics are visualized using Matplotlib, providing insights into the model's performance over time.

## Future Work

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) to improve model performance.

- **Transfer Learning**: Implement transfer learning using pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet to leverage their learned features.

- **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model as a web application or API for real-time image classification.
